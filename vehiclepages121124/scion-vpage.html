<h2>OEM Parts for Your Scion </h2>
<p>Established by <a href=/v-toyota style="color: #E61464;">Toyota</a>, Scion hit the US market in 2003 and immediately attracted a legion of drivers with its impressive compact car lineup. Although the brand is now discontinued, many owners continue to use Scion as a reliable daily driver.</p>

<p>Here are three Scion models we love with recommended maintenance:</p>

<h3>Scion tC</h3>
<p>Short for "touring coupe," the <a href=/v-scion-tc style="color: #E61464;">tC</a> is Scion's compact coupe with an aggressively sporty design and a panoramic sunroof. Keep it in top condition with <a href=/oil-pan-gaskets style="color: #E61464;">regular oil changes</a> and <a href=/oil-filters style="color: #E61464;">filter</a> checks.</p>

<h3>Scion xB</h3>
<p>For a more aggressive design profile, look to the <a href=/c-scion-xb style="color: #E61464;">xB</a>. The XB is Scion's utility vehicle with a distinctive boxy design, roomy <a href=/interior style="color: #E61464;">interior</a>, and impressive interior and exterior upgrade options. Knock it out of the park by referring to your owner's model for the recommended maintenance schedule.</p>

<h3>Scion iQ</h3>
<p>One of Scion's most popular models, the iQ, is the smallest vehicle in the lineup. It offers <a href=/seats style="color: #E61464;">comfortable seating</a> (with a 3+1 seating configuration), impressive maneuverability for tight parking spots, and impressive fuel economy. Recommended maintenance for the iQ indicates regular oil changes, brake inspections, tire rotations, and fluid checks.</p>
